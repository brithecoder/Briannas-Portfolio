# 👩🏾‍💻 Brianna Gordon | Frontend Software Developer Portfolio
Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio. This site is designed to showcase my journey from enterprise finance systems at Morgan Stanley to my current focus on Cloud-native AI interfaces. It serves as a live demonstration of my technical standards in React, TypeScript, and UI/UX architecture.

## 🚀 The Vision
My portfolio is built to reflect my transition into Senior-level leadership. It highlights my ability to bridge the gap between complex backend logic (like cloud-integrated LLMs) and warm, accessible user interfaces.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
**Framework:** React 18 with Vite for lightning-fast HMR.

**Language:** TypeScript (Strict Mode) for enterprise-grade type safety.

**Styling:** Tailwind CSS for a modern, utility-first design.

**Animations:** Framer Motion for sophisticated, high-performance UI transitions.

**Icons:** Lucide-React for a clean, consistent visual language.

**Deployment:** Hosted on Netlify with custom CI/CD pipelines.

## ✨ Key Features & Engineering Wins
**Responsive Masonry Grid:** Implemented a custom "About Me" highlights section using CSS columns and break-inside-avoid logic to handle varying content heights elegantly.

**Enterprise-Grade Theming:** Built a cohesive design system using a refined color palette that balances professional "FinTech" blue/purples with warm, approachable pinks.


**Migration-Inspired Architecture:** The codebase is structured with modularity in mind, reflecting my professional experience in large-scale Angular to React migrations.
